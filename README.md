## how to use
1. install trime.apk to your android device, run once then quit
2. upload *.yaml to your inner storage system, something like "/storage/emulated/0/rime"
3. run app trime again, choose your keyboard --> theme as 极点二笔, choose input --> scheme as 极点二笔
4. deploy and have fun to use it
5. I left enough key space for the key "123", intended to make a emoji key button, but not finished yet
